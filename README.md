## A-Eye - AI that helps healthcare professionals diagnose eye disease

![A-Eye Application](https://www.tdumartin.com/img/A-Eye_WebDesign.png)

A-Eye is an AI that helps healthcare professionals diagnose eye disease based on a fundus image.
To carry out this project, we used a **dataset of 6,000 patients comprising 12,000 fundus images** of the eye labeled by doctors.

### Test our AI
You can test our AI here -> https://od-recognition.herokuapp.com/ <br>
And can find below some image to test it !<br>
**But before using our AI, can you find what kind of disease the eyes below have ?** <br><br>

### Models
A-Eye is **3 deep learning models (Convolutional Neural Network)** which follow one another to achieve the most accurate results possible.

ðŸ‘‰ The first model detects whether the image matches a fundus image.<br>
The model was trained on a database of **60,000 images classified into 10 categories**.

ðŸ‘‰ The second model detects whether the eye is healthy or sick.<br>
We used a transfer learning method, **InceptionV3**, a pre-trained model with more than 23 millions parameters.

ðŸ‘‰ Finally, the third model detects the disease.<br> (6 possible categories: Cataract / Glaucoma / Macular Degeneration / Myopia / Hypertension / Other)<br>
We used the **VGG16**, a pre-trained model with over 150 million parameters.
